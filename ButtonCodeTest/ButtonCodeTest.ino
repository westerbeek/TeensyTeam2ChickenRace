/*
  Button
 
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital  
 pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2. 
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 10 to ground 
 * pushbutton attached to pin 8 from ground
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 8 from +3.3V
 
 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// constants won't change. They're used here to 
// set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 8;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  10;      // the number of the LED pin
  // Pin 13: Arduino has an LED connected on pin 13
  // Pin 11: Teensy 2.0 has the LED on pin 11
  // Pin  6: Teensy++ 2.0 has the LED on pin 6
  // Pin 13: Teensy 3.0 has the LED on pin 13

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);     

  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop(){
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is LOW:
  if (buttonState == LOW) {     
    // turn LED on:    
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  
    Serial.println("Button is pressed!");
    Keyboard.print("Hello");//Keyboard.press(x);
  } 
  else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); 
    Serial.println("Button is not pressed...");
  }
  
  delay(50);              // wait for a 1/20 second
